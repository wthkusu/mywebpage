    <h2>Shiv Kailash - Live in Mumbai</h2>

    <p>
        On huge public demand, and as promised, I’m thrilled to present this cherished 
        <strong>Himachali folk bhajan</strong> dedicated to Lord Shiva: Shiv Kailash.
    </p>

    <p>
        This soulful bhajan from <strong>Himachal Pradesh</strong> is a beautiful ode to Lord Shiva, 
        the ruler of the majestic Dhauladhar mountain range and the eternal resident of Mount Kailash.
    </p>

    <p>
        This live performance was part of Rishab's Sitar for
        <strong>Mental Health India Tour 2024</strong> in Mumbai.
